## What is Space Defender
Space Defender is a game which you can categorize as a Tower Defense game. Its a fun game with a great challenge at the end. The essential idea of Space Defender is that you will defend the **Earth** from being enhabited by spaceships. Every space ship entering the Earth will mean that it gets damage. Earth has health where as it is **zero** you lost the game. In Tower Defense fashion you will defend the Earth by placing towers, or in our case UFO's, which will defend Earth. But because nothing comes cheap you need to buy those towers which makes it quite difficult to win. This means you need to have a strategy if you want to get far. Luckily you will earn money for killing enemy spaceships. The rest you have to see for yourself.
